Description: I used CodeAcademy Pro to give myself an intro to HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I went through a total of 10 lessons and did some short and fairly simple projects on each (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to help solidfy some of the basic topics covered in the lessons:
HTML: Wrote HTML for a New York City Blog (CSS file and Blog Content provided)
CSS: Using CSS selectors, redesigned a recipe website (Website content provided)
JavaScript: Temperature conversions

What I learned: I learned a lot about the basic concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My team is building a website so we decided that whoever didn't know the basics of these three topics should review them. So I spent about all my time just trying to learn these concepts and these lessons were good intros to them.

What didn't work: The projects were fairly simple. CodeAcademy covers basic concepts in great detail and makes everything very easy to follow. They also guide you through the projects very well.
